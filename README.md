# uio_projects
These folders contain several algorithms/programs in C++ developed for Computational Physics course at UiO.
In addition there are matlab codes used to analyze the data obtained by the simulation. We explain briefly the main content of these folders but all the codes in C++ are commented.

P1: solver of one-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions 

P2: Schroedinger’s equation for two electrons in a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator well

P3: Building a model for the solar system using ordinary differ- ential equations

P4: Studies of phase transitions in magnetic systems with Ising model

P5: study of the numerical stability of three methods for diffusion equation & Temperature distribution in the lithosphere

the following folders have the same content of the P folders but with some additional codes

diffusion: a program used to solve the diffusion equation (PDE)

function: a function to write to file and an eigenvalue solver developed with Jacobi’s method

gaussian_elimination: a solver for a one dimensional differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions

ising_model: a simulation of a phase transition of 2x2 lattice using the Ising model, a statistical analysis of the model is also added

sch_eq: a solver for the Schrodinger equation of an harmonic oscillator

solarsystem: a program to simulate the orbits of the planets and a program to compare the relativistic correction of the Mercury’s orbit with the newtonian prediction
