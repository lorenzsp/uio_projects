# uio_projects
These folders contain several algorithms/programs in C++ developed for Computational Physics course at UiO.
In addition there are matlab codes used to analyze the data obtained by the simulation. We explain briefly the main content of these folders but all the codes in C++ are commented.

diffusion: a program used to solve the diffusion equation (PDE)

function: a function to write to file and an eigenvalue solver developed with Jacobi’s method

gaussian_elimination: a solver for a one dimensional differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions

ising_model: a simulation of a phase transition of 2x2 lattice using the Ising model, a statistical analysis of the model is also added

sch_eq: a solver for the Schrodinger equation of an harmonic oscillator

solarsystem: a program to simulate the orbits of the planets and a program to compare the relativistic correction of the Mercury’s orbit with the newtonian prediction
